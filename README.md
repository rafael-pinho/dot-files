Linux configuration files and scripts. 

This is not a project. This is just my linux config files and scripts. I put here because is better than a backup and I can document all here. But you can use too. To use any file you can clone this repo with git or:

```
curl file-raw-url > my-new-file.sh
chmod +x my-new-file.sh
./my-new-file.sh
```

See a list of avaliable files below.
