Linux configuration files and scripts. 

This is not a project. This is just my linux config files and scripts. 
I put this files here because is better than backup and I can document all here. 
Well, you can use this files too. Just clone or:

```
curl file-raw-url > my-new-file.sh
chmod +x my-new-file.sh
./my-new-file.sh
```
